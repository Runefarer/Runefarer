### Here be a Runefarer
Not quite dragons, just a humble Zeroth Circle Runefarer. What is that? Someone who is interested, although as a beginner of varying levels, in
- Programming
- Mathematics
- Art
- Music
- Writing

And you know what happens when all those come together? **Runefaring**!

### I do coding!
I started on December 23 2020, learning from the wonderful Runefarers behind [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). I found myself immediately immersed into it, and I kept going and going and going, until I finished the JavaScript parts. And boy was that fun! I'm quite confident in my skills now, too!

Also, I've recently found myself enjoying [Clash of Code](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode), and I'm always up to play a few games!

### Current Project: [Markdown Notes App](https://github.com/Runefarer/md-notes)
I made a [Markdown Previewer](https://codepen.io/Runefarer/full/mdOJwGO) for a freeCodeCamp project, and when I was later thinking of ideas for my own project, I came up with a notes app in Markdown. I've been having a lot of fun working on it, from wrestling with DraftJS and partial parsing, to, now, designing in Figma!

### Other Stuff
I'm a big fan of video games, especially deep, lore based ones. I especially like CRPGs like Pathfinder: Kingmaker, Divinity: Original Sin (2), and Pillars of Eternity (2)! I also like to read a lot, preferring fantasy themed stories. When not coding, I'm usually playing or reading.
